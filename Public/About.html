    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Eric Bunch. I am currently a senior property systems technician 
        at Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center. I am mainly responsible for
        training new hires, but I have a lot of experience managing the large ecosystem
        of devices we have on the property. This requires things like configuring switches,
        configuring user profiles using Active Directory, monitoring network traffic for conventions,
        and pretty much everything in between. In my personal life I really enjoy playing video games,
        trying new foods, and spending time with my wife. I am creating this so that I can get some more
        experience with front end development as well as showing off some of the skills that I am learning
        along the way.
