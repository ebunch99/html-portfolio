        <h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>
        <h2>This is a list of some of my favorite video games.</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>1. Baldur's Gate 3</h3>
        <p>This was one of my favorite games I have ever played. The developers
            thought of every little detail and it really shows.
        </p>
        <h3>2. World of Warcraft</h3>
        <p>I started playing this back in 2008 and I still play it
            to this day. I have played every expansion and I just love
            how fun the gameplay loop is and how much joy it still brings me to
            play it today.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Halo 3</h3>
        <p>Nostalgia trip! This game took up a lot of my childhood and I still
            have some very fond memories of it. I still jump back in and play
            it every now and then just for fun.
